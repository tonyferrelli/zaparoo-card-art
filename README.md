A collection of templates to create your own Zaparoo (formerly TapTo) designs and apply to NFC cards. These slightly oversized templates are designed to be applied easily by hand for quick, consistently square and neat results. No need for special tools or applicators. You might already have everything you need at home to start today!:
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free) and a little knowledge on how to use it.
* A colour printer.
* A laminator, or even clear contact adhesive.
* Double sided adhesive tape, or alternately, "Avery" adhesive labels. There is a template supplied suitable for L7108REV labels.
* A lightbox. You can easy to cobble together a home made one. I made one with a lunchbox container and small torch. Even your smartphone showing a white image at full brightness will do the job. Otherwise, consider getting one off Ali Express, or covert that old flatbed scanner you were about to throw out.
* Scissors.
* A little patience.

### Construction
Once you have created your design to a template in Inkscape, follow this basic process.
* Import it into a new blank sheet and **print directly from Inkscape**.
* Alternately, import it into a copy of `L7108REV Blank Print Sheet.svg`. These will allow you to import and print 9 designs. Print this **directly from Inkscape**.
* Run it through your laminator or apply clear contact adhesive.
* Cut the cards _outside_ of the dotted rectangle.
* If you are not using Avery style adhesive sheets, apply double sided tape to the NFC card.
* Place the cut out label face down on your lightbed source.
* To apply it onto your NFC card, keep the card at a sharp angle and **align the long end inside the dotted outline**. At this sharp angle, adjust it carefully and take your time. You want to make sure the long end is perfectly square and the top and bottoms are not overlapping the dotted guides. Once it is aligned, tilt it down and apply the adhesive. This process becomes quick and easy after doing it a few times.
* The card should now have the oversized label applied. Trim with scissors to remove the dotted guides.

### What can go wrong?
If you take your time applying the labels, you should expect great results. Here is what can go wrong, so check this before starting:
* The size of your NFC card is a little different. So far I have only tried a single supplier, where the cards are the standard 54mm x 86mm.
* If you are using "Avery" style labels, the placement of the cards might vary. You will need to adjust the `L7108REV Blank Print Sheet.svg` template to suit.
* You print or export outside of Inkscape. This may slightly alter the dimensions, even when exporting to a PDF.

### Using the `L7108REV` template.
The `L7108REV Blank Print Sheet.svg` contains:
* 9 bright pink outlines. These should be completely covered by the template you imported.
* Guides for aligning.

To populate this sheet:
* Go to File> Import or `Ctrl + I` and select your design.
* Accept the default import prompts, if it appears.
* Click and drag your design to the bottom left corner of a blank outline. The template should snap to the blue guides.

Once populated, **print directly from Inkscape**.
