"Pure Bit" is a collection of templates that echo the design of the original box art and cartridges, while attempting keeping the layout simple and generally 'flat'.

These templates often have several regions and variants available using layers. Switch these in and out of view using the "Layers and Objects" dialogue box. Simply click the eye icon to toggle these layers. Many of these layers have sub-layers grouped within them swap in and out other details. If you cannot see the "Layers and Objects" dialogue box, click View> Show/Hide Dialogues or press `F12`.

The templates have guides on them to assist arranging your design:
* There is a red guide to denote the boundary of NFC cards. Anything beyond that will be snipped out.
* The green guides are a few millimetres in from the boundary. Try to keep content inside this area, the closer you get to the red guide, the more likely elements will be snipped out due to tolerances.

The templates also have placeholder artwork as a guide. Replace these with your own, obviously.

### master_system_blank_v_purebit

Vertically orientated with the classic grid design of the box art and cartridge labels with some unwanted bonuses too. The top label has three variants:
* Label AU - Red label with a white hatch that was used only in Australia.
* Label International - Red label with a black hatch used everywhere else except for Japan that marketed the Console as the MkIII.
* Label Blue - Blue label with a white hatch. This was used everywhere except for Japan later on in the consoles life.

#### Title text
An example title text is shown on the layer named 'Title'. This itself has two layers:
* Title Overlay. This is the black text you read.
* Title Underlay, which sits below it. This is a duplicate of the Title Overlay layer, but with a much thicker white stroke style. This adds a small amount of white space relief from the grey grid pattern to improve legibility. This white space buffer was used on original designs.
The example text uses the Georgia font, which is readily available, in black with reduced spacing between letters. This mimics the look of early releases . Feel free to use variations to your tastes, as the same game in various regions used slightly different fonts in various shades of a dark blue or navy. The font originally used appears to be ITC Modern.

#### Bonus OziSoft stickers
The Master System was distributed in Australia by a company called OziSoft. They made a real nuisance out of themselves by adding all sorts of unwanted stickers to the game boxes. Particularly galling was _that they applied it to the actual insert_ instead of the box, so they could not be removed without damaging the artwork. Relive the anger this bought you by making the OziSoft Stickers layer visible. The stickers included here are:
* STUCK? black and white label. This promotes an expensive hint line and an irritating exclusive distributor rights spiel below it. These usually appeared on Mega Drive games though.
* NOT PERMITTED FOR RENTAL. This was often slapped on the front art work hoping it would stop rental stores.
* HINTS & TIPS HOTLINE. This long, vertical sticker was often awkwardly place along the back spline, always crooked so it spilled over to the spine.
* CLASSICS. A lot of people would be familiar with this. Sometimes it wasn't a sticker - it was part of the re-printed insert sleeve. Used and seen a lot.
* HINTS & TIPS HOTLINE. Similar to the long one.
* DISTRIBUTED BY OZISOFT. This is some ugly artwork of a Koala sitting in front of a computer.  OziSoft started out distributing software for home computers. You don't care that your game was distributed by OziSoft, but OziSoft want you to know whether you like it or not.
* NIAL. These small stickers more subtly denoted that they were distributed by OziSoft. NIAL is apparently an acronym for _National Interactive and Leisure_ or maybe _Nippon International Limited_, supposedly an early name for OziSoft.

### nes_blank_v_purebit

Vertically orientated with a few different styles to choose from.

#### Black Label
This mimics the design of the early release "Black Label" games, with a the black angled rectangle and bright, bold text. The title text is Arial Black and tilted.

#### Konami Aperture
This mimics the design of a few Konami games, like Contra and Castlevania, that had the artwork behind a grey aperture effect.


### snes_blank_v_purebit
Vertically orientated with two main variants.

#### International / PAL
This variant mimics the box art used outside of the US. It uses the colourful SNES pad button logo, the bold black/ coloured swatch panel and an homage to the international cartridge at the bottom.
* The coloured panel is named 'Right Panel Swatch' and is yellow by default. Select this layer and then select the "Fill and Stroke" dialogue to change the fill colour as required.
* For those that are triggered by the big "PAL VERSION" stamp, swap visibility between the "Super Nintendo Imprint PAL VERSION" and "Super Nintendo Imprint International" layers.

#### US NTSC
This variant mimics that unique box art and cartridges used in the US only with the black and grey button aperture logo and along with the typically 90's shapes spread around the place. This contains a sub layer named "Suggested artwork location" to help guide where to place the artwork.
